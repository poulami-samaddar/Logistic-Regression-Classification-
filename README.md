# Logistic-Regression-Classification-
## Logistic Regression Projects
This section includes two logistic regression projects completed during Udemy course (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Boot camp) taught by Jose Portilla. 
## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
The model will predict a classification - Survival or Deceased depending on different features  
* Pclass,  
* Age, 
* SibSp, 
* Parch, 
* Fare, 
* Sex, 
* Embarked

Titanic Data Set from Kaggle is used for this project. Some data cleaning and data processing job is also done before using into a logistic regression model. After training 82% accuracy is achieved.  


## Project 2: Ad Click Prediction
In this project a logistic regression model is predicted using advertising data set. After training the model can predict if a particular user clicked on an Advertisement. This data set contains the following features    
* 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
* 'Age': consumer age in years
* 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
* 'City': City of consumer
* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
* 'Country': Country of consumer
* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

After training 97% accuracy is achieved.
