# Logistic-Regression-Classification-
## Logistic Regression Projects
This section includes two linear regression projects completed during Udemy course (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Boot camp) taught by Jose Portilla. 
## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
###### Summary:
The model will predict a classification - Survival or Deceased depending on different features  
* Pclass,  
* Age, 
* SibSp, 
* Parch, 
* Fare, 
* Sex, 
* Embarked

Titanic Data Set from Kaggle is used for this project. Some data cleaning and data processing job is also done before using into a logistic regression model. After training 82% accuracy is achived.
